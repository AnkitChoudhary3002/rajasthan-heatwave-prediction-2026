🔥 Heatwave Prediction in Rajasthan (Summer 2026)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting heatwave conditions in Rajasthan for Summer 2026 using historical daily climate data.
The current implementation analyzes summer-season heatwaves, while the underlying dataset contains multi-year daily meteorological records, enabling extension to daily forecasting and time-series modeling in a production environment.

The project is being developed as a scalable ML pipeline, with emphasis on maintainability, reproducibility, and future deployment.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze historical temperature and humidity patterns related to heatwaves

Compute heat index and classify heatwave severity

Build a baseline predictive model for summer heatwaves

Design a pipeline that supports daily forecasting

Prepare the system for time-series forecasting and production use

📊 Dataset
